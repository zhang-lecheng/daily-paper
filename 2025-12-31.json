    "summary": "Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a life-threatening obstetric complication involving abnormal placental invasion into the uterine wall. Early and accurate prenatal diagnosis is essential to reduce maternal and neonatal risks. This study aimed to develop and validate a deep learning framework that enhances PAS detection by integrating multiple imaging modalities. A multimodal deep learning model was designed using an intermediate feature-level fusion architecture combining 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and 2D Ultrasound (US) scans. Unimodal feature extractors, a 3D DenseNet121-Vision Transformer for MRI and a 2D ResNet50 for US, were selected after systematic comparative analysis. Curated datasets comprising 1,293 MRI and 1,143 US scans were used to train the unimodal models and paired samples of patient-matched MRI-US scans was isolated for multimodal model development and evaluation. On an independent test set, the multimodal fusion model achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 92.5% and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.927, outperforming the MRI-only (82.5%, AUC 0.825) and US-only (87.5%, AUC 0.879) models. Integrating MRI and US features provides complementary diagnostic information, demonstrating strong potential to enhance prenatal risk assessment and improve patient outcomes.",

    "summary": "Photonics is becoming a cornerstone technology for high-performance AI systems and scientific computing, offering unparalleled speed, parallelism, and energy efficiency. Despite this promise, the design and deployment of electronic-photonic AI systems remain highly challenging due to a steep learning curve across multiple layers, spanning device physics, circuit design, system architecture, and AI algorithms. The absence of a mature electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) toolchain leads to long, inefficient design cycles and limits cross-disciplinary innovation and co-evolution. In this work, we present a cross-layer co-design and automation framework aimed at democratizing photonic AI system development. We begin by introducing our architecture designs for scalable photonic edge AI and Transformer inference, followed by SimPhony, an open-source modeling tool for rapid EPIC AI system evaluation and design-space exploration. We then highlight advances in AI-enabled photonic design automation, including physical AI-based Maxwell solvers, a fabrication-aware inverse design framework, and a scalable inverse training algorithm for meta-optical neural networks, enabling a scalable EPDA stack for next-generation electronic-photonic AI systems.",

    "summary": "In this work, we identify three considerations that are essential for realizing practical photonic AI systems at scale: (1) dynamic tensor operation support for modern models rather than only weight-static kernels, especially for attention/Transformer-style workloads; (2) systematic management of conversion, control, and data-movement overheads, where multiplexing and dataflow must amortize electronic costs instead of letting ADC/DAC and I/O dominate; and (3) robustness under hardware non-idealities that become more severe as integration density grows. To study these coupled tradeoffs quantitatively, and to ensure they remain meaningful under real implementation constraints, we build a cross-layer toolchain that supports photonic AI design from early exploration to physical realization. SimPhony provides implementation-aware modeling and rapid cross-layer evaluation, translating physical costs into system-level metrics so architectural decisions are grounded in realistic assumptions. ADEPT and ADEPT-Z enable end-to-end circuit and topology exploration, connecting system objectives to feasible photonic fabrics under practical device and circuit constraints. Finally, Apollo and LiDAR provide scalable photonic physical design automation, turning candidate circuits into manufacturable layouts while accounting for routing, thermal, and crosstalk constraints.",

    "summary": "Resilient intermodal freight networks are vital for sustaining supply chains amid increasing threats from natural hazards and cyberattacks. While transportation resilience has been widely studied, understanding how random and targeted disruptions affect both structural connectivity and functional performance remains a key challenge. To address this, our study evaluates the robustness of the U.S. intermodal freight network, comprising rail and water modes, using a simulation-based framework that integrates graph-theoretic metrics with flow-weighted centrality measures. We examine disruption scenarios including random failures as well as targeted node and edge removals based on static and dynamically updated degree and betweenness centrality. To reflect more realistic conditions, we also consider flow-weighted degree centralities and partial node degradation. Two resilience indicators are used: the size of the giant connected component (GCC) to measure structural connectivity, and flow-weighted network efficiency (NE) to assess freight mobility under disruption. Results show that progressively degrading nodes ranked by Weighted Degree Centrality to 60% of their original functionality causes a sharper decline in normalized NE, for up to approximately 45 affected nodes, than complete failure (100% loss of functionality) applied to nodes targeted by weighted betweenness centrality or selected at random. This highlights how partial degradation of high-tonnage hubs can produce disproportionately large functional losses. The findings emphasize the need for resilience strategies that go beyond network topology to incorporate freight flow dynamics.",

    "summary": "Inventory management remains a challenge for many small and medium-sized businesses that lack the expertise to deploy advanced optimization methods. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help bridge this gap. We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant \"hallucination tax\": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.   To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned \"digital twin\" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational. Our results position LLMs not as replacements for operations research, but as natural-language interfaces that make rigorous, solver-based policies accessible to non-experts.",

Utilizing a curated dataset of images, we evaluated the models' ability to match objects to appropriate recycling bins, including assessing whether the items could physically fit into the available bins. Additionally, we investigated the models' performance across several challenging scenarios: (i) adjusting predictions based on location-specific recycling guidelines; (ii) accounting for contamination or structural damage; and (iii) handling objects composed of multiple materials. Our findings highlight the significant advancements in contextual understanding offered by these models compared to previous iterations, while also identifying areas where they still fall short. The continued refinement of context-aware models is crucial for enhancing public recycling practices and advancing environmental sustainability.",

    "summary": "We present GRL-SNAM, a geometric reinforcement learning framework for Simultaneous Navigation and Mapping(SNAM) in unknown environments. A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping.

Mortar combines a quality-diversity algorithm with a large language model to explore a diverse set of mechanics, which are evaluated by synthesising complete games that incorporate both evolved mechanics and those drawn from an archive. The mechanics are evaluated by composing complete games through a tree search procedure, where the resulting games are evaluated by their ability to preserve a skill-based ordering over players -- that is, whether stronger players consistently outperform weaker ones. We assess the mechanics based on their contribution towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We demonstrate that Mortar produces games that appear diverse and playable, and mechanics that contribute more towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We perform ablation studies to assess the role of each system component and a user study to evaluate the games based on human feedback.",

    "summary": "Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is a highly effective optimization technique. A primary challenge when applying CMA-ES in high dimensionality is sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with an arbitrary covariance matrix, which involves its decomposition. The cubic complexity of this process is the main obstacle to applying CMA-ES in highdimensional spaces. We introduce a version of CMA-ES that uses no covariance matrix at all. In the proposed matrix-free CMA-ES, an archive stores the vectors of differences between individuals and the midpoint, normalized by the step size. New individuals are generated as the weighted combinations of the vectors from the archive. We prove that the probability distribution of individuals generated by the proposed method is identical to that of the standard CMA-ES. Experimental results show that reducing the archive size to store only a fixed number of the most recent populations is sufficient, without compromising optimization efficiency. The matrix-free and matrix-based CMA-ES achieve comparable results on the quadratic function when the step-size adaptation is turned off. When coupled with the step-size adaptation method, the matrix-free CMA-ES converges faster than the matrix-based, and usually yields the results of a comparable or superior quality, according to the results obtained for the CEC'2017 benchmark suite. Presented approach simplifies the algorithm, offers a novel perspective on covariance matrix adaptation, and serves as a stepping stone toward even more efficient methods.",

    "summary": "We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.",

Specifically, we show that a simple noise optimization objective can mitigate mode collapse while preserving the fidelity of the base model.

    "summary": "Blind source separation, particularly through independent component analysis (ICA), is widely utilized across various signal processing domains for disentangling underlying components from observed mixed signals, owing to its fully data-driven nature that minimizes reliance on prior assumptions. However, conventional ICA methods rely on an assumption of linear mixing, limiting their ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships and to maintain robustness in noisy environments. In this work, we present deep deterministic nonlinear independent component analysis (DDICA), a novel deep neural network-based framework designed to address these limitations. DDICA leverages a matrix-based entropy function to directly optimize the independence criterion via stochastic gradient descent, bypassing the need for variational approximations or adversarial schemes. This results in a streamlined training process and improved resilience to noise. We validated the effectiveness and generalizability of DDICA across a range of applications, including simulated signal mixtures, hyperspectral image unmixing, modeling of primary visual receptive fields, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that DDICA effectively separates independent components with high accuracy across a range of applications. These findings suggest that DDICA offers a robust and versatile solution for blind source separation in diverse signal processing tasks.",

    "summary": "Robotic systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments increasingly require planners that satisfy complex task sequences while adhering to strict temporal constraints. Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) offers a formal and expressive framework for specifying such time-bounded requirements; however, integrating MITL with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to stochastic dynamics and partial observability. This paper presents a unified automata-based RL framework for synthesizing policies in both Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) under MITL specifications. MITL formulas are translated into Timed Limit-Deterministic Generalized Büchi Automata (Timed-LDGBA) and synchronized with the underlying decision process to construct product timed models suitable for Q-learning. A simple yet expressive reward structure enforces temporal correctness while allowing additional performance objectives. The approach is validated in three simulation studies: a $5 \\times 5$ grid-world formulated as an MDP, a $10 \\times 10$ grid-world formulated as a POMDP, and an office-like service-robot scenario. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently learns policies that satisfy strict time-bounded requirements under stochastic transitions, scales to larger state spaces, and remains effective in partially observable environments, highlighting its potential for reliable robotic planning in time-critical and uncertain settings.",

    "title": "Exploration in the Limit",
    "summary": "In fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI), the objective is to quickly identify the optimal option while controlling the probability of error below a desired threshold. Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances. Experiments suggest our approach reduces average sample complexities while maintaining error control.",

    "summary": "Wearable technologies have the potential to transform ambulatory and at-home hemodynamic monitoring by providing continuous assessments of cardiovascular health metrics and guiding clinical management. However, existing cuffless wearable devices for blood pressure (BP) monitoring often rely on methods lacking theoretical foundations, such as pulse wave analysis or pulse arrival time, making them vulnerable to physiological and experimental confounders that undermine their accuracy and clinical utility. Here, we developed a smartwatch device with real-time electrical bioimpedance (BioZ) sensing for cuffless hemodynamic monitoring. We elucidate the biophysical relationship between BioZ and BP via a multiscale analytical and computational modeling framework, and identify physiological, anatomical, and experimental parameters that influence the pulsatile BioZ signal at the wrist. A signal-tagged physics-informed neural network incorporating fluid dynamics principles enables calibration-free estimation of BP and radial and axial blood velocity. We successfully tested our approach with healthy individuals at rest and after physical activity including physical and autonomic challenges, and with patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease in outpatient and intensive care settings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of BioZ technology for cuffless BP and blood velocity monitoring, addressing critical limitations of existing cuffless technologies.",

    "summary": "Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) are a covert and persistent form of organized exploitation that operate under the facade of legitimate wellness services while facilitating human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and coerced labor. Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on.   To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges.   Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.",

    "title": "Non-Contact and Non-Destructive Detection of Structural Defects in Bioprinted Constructs Using Video-Based Vibration Analysis",
    "summary": "Bioprinting technology has advanced significantly in the fabrication of tissue-like constructs with complex geometries for regenerative medicine. However, maintaining the structural integrity of bioprinted materials remains a major challenge, primarily due to the frequent and unexpected formation of hidden defects. Traditional defect detection methods often require physical contact that may not be suitable for hydrogel-based biomaterials due to their inherently soft nature, making non-invasive and straightforward structural evaluation necessary in this field. To advance the state of the art, this study presents a novel non-contact method for non-destructively detecting structural defects in bioprinted constructs using video-based vibration analysis. Ear-shaped constructs were fabricated using a bioink composed of sodium alginate and \\k{appa}-carrageenan using extrusion-based bioprinting. To simulate printing defects, controlled geometric, interlayer, and pressure-induced defects were systematically introduced into the samples. The dynamic response of each structure was recorded using a high-speed camera and analyzed via phase-based motion estimation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that all defective samples exhibit consistent changes in the dynamic characteristics compared to baseline samples, with increasingly pronounced deviation observed as defect severity increases, which reflect changes in effective stiffness and mass distribution induced by internal anomalies, even when such defects are not detectable through surface inspection. The experimental trends were also validated through finite element simulations. Overall, this work demonstrates that video-based vibrometry is a powerful approach for assessing the quality of bioprinted constructs, offering a practical pathway toward robust structural health monitoring in next-generation bio-additive manufacturing workflows.",

    "summary": "As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.",

    "summary": "The open-weight LLM ecosystem is increasingly defined by model composition techniques (such as weight merging, speculative decoding, and vocabulary expansion) that remix capabilities from diverse sources. A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single \"breaker token\" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

    "title": "SpaceTimePilot: Generative Rendering of Dynamic Scenes Across Space and Time",
    "summary": "We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.",

Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions.

    "summary": "Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.   We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.   We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.",

    "summary": "Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.   B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.",

In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.",

The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%.

    "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.",

    "title": "Generative Classifiers Avoid Shortcut Solutions",
    "summary": "Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.",

Pediatric PAH remains understudied due to limited data and the lack of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for four pediatric PAH patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data collected approximately two years apart. Using the CRIMSON simulation framework, we coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of the pulmonary arteries with zero-dimensional (0D) lumped-parameter heart and Windkessel models to simulate patient hemodynamics. An automated Python-based optimizer was developed to calibrate boundary conditions by minimizing discrepancies between simulated and clinical metrics, reducing calibration time from weeks to days. Model-derived metrics such as arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity, resistance, and compliance were found to align with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. Our findings demonstrate that computational modeling can non-invasively capture patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, offering a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.",

    "summary": "Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.",

    "summary": "Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.",

    "summary": "Multicommodity capacitated network design (MCND) models can be used to optimize the consolidation of shipments within e-commerce fulfillment networks. In practice, fulfillment networks require that shipments with the same origin and destination follow the same transfer path. This unsplittable flow requirement complicates the MCND problem, requiring integer programming (IP) formulations in which binary variables replace continuous flow variables. To enhance the solvability of this variant of the MCND problem for large-scale logistics networks, this work focuses on strengthening dual bounds. We investigate the polyhedra of arc-set relaxations, and we introduce two new classes of valid inequalities that can be implemented within solution approaches. We develop one approach that dynamically adds valid inequalities to the root node of a reformulation of the MCND IP with additional valid metric inequalities. We show the effectiveness of our ideas with a comprehensive computational study using path-based fulfillment instances, constructed from data provided by a large U.S.-based e-commerce company, and the well-known arc-based Canad instances. Experiments show that our best solution approach for a practical path-based model reduces the IP gap by an average of 26.5% and 22.5% for the two largest instance groups, compared to solving the reformulation alone, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the dual bound. In addition, experiments using only the arc-based relaxation highlight the strength of our new valid inequalities relative to the linear programming relaxation (LPR), yielding an IP-gap reduction of more than 85%.",

We decompose the generalization error of DGFMs into an approximation and a training error. We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity.",

    "summary": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.",

While related inequalities appear in the literature, we isolate and highlight a specific form and develop it as a well-rounded tool for statistical analysis. Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $θ_0$ with current iterate $θ_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(θ_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $θ_0$, $θ_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models.",

However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task.

To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis.

We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models.

    "summary": "As a critical application of computational intelligence in remote sensing, deep learning-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image target recognition facilitates intelligent perception but typically relies on centralized training, where multi-source SAR data are uploaded to a single server, raising privacy and security concerns. Federated learning (FL) provides an emerging computational intelligence paradigm for SAR image target recognition, enabling cross-site collaboration while preserving local data privacy. However, FL confronts critical security risks, where malicious clients can exploit SAR's multiplicative speckle noise to conceal backdoor triggers, severely challenging the robustness of the computational intelligence model. To address this challenge, we propose NADAFD, a noise-aware and dynamically adaptive federated defense framework that integrates frequency-domain, spatial-domain, and client-behavior analyses to counter SAR-specific backdoor threats. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain collaborative inversion mechanism to expose cross-client spectral inconsistencies indicative of hidden backdoor triggers. We further design a noise-aware adversarial training strategy that embeds $Γ$-distributed speckle characteristics into mask-guided adversarial sample generation to enhance robustness against both backdoor attacks and SAR speckle noise. In addition, we present a dynamic health assessment module that tracks client update behaviors across training rounds and adaptively adjusts aggregation weights to mitigate evolving malicious contributions. Experiments on MSTAR and OpenSARShip datasets demonstrate that NADAFD achieves higher accuracy on clean test samples and a lower backdoor attack success rate on triggered inputs than existing federated backdoor defenses for SAR target recognition.",

To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms.

    "title": "Attribution-Guided Distillation of Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders",
    "summary": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels",

    "summary": "Compressed deep learning models are crucial for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices. However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.",

    "summary": "The Born-Mayer-Huggins (BMH) potential, which combines Coulomb interactions with dispersion and short-range exponential repulsion, is widely used for ionic materials such as molten salts. However, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of BMH systems are often limited by computation, communication, and memory costs. We recently proposed the random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method, which accelerates Coulomb calculations by using a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition to split the potential into short- and long-range parts and by applying importance sampling in Fourier space for the long-range part. In this work, we extend the RBSOG to BMH systems and incorporate a random batch list (RBL) scheme to further accelerate the short-range part, yielding a unified framework for efficient simulations with the BMH potential. The combination of the SOG decomposition and the RBL enables an efficient and scalable treatment of both long- and short-range interactions in BMH system, particularly the RBL well handles the medium-range exponential repulsion and dispersion by the random batch neighbor list. Error estimate is provided to show the theoretical convergence of the RBL force. We evaluate the framework on molten NaCl and mixed alkali halide with up to $5\\times10^6$ atoms on $2048$ CPU cores. Compared to the Ewald-based particle-particle particle-mesh method and the RBSOG-only method, our method achieves approximately $4\\sim10\\times$ and $2\\times$ speedups while using $1000$ cores, respectively, under the same level of structural and thermodynamic accuracy and with a reduced memory usage. These results demonstrate the attractive performance of our method in accuracy and scalability for MD simulations with long-range interactions.",

    "title": "Dichotomous Diffusion Policy Optimization",
    "summary": "Diffusion-based policies have gained growing popularity in solving a wide range of decision-making tasks due to their superior expressiveness and controllable generation during inference. However, effectively training large diffusion policies using reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news \"slop.\" Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.   Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.   Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.",

    "summary": "Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.",

    "summary": "Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.   We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.   From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).",

STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.",

    "summary": "Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $λ$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control.

    "summary": "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.",

    "summary": "Accurate grading of corn kernels is critical for seed certification, directional seeding, and breeding, yet it is still predominantly performed by manual inspection. This work introduces CornViT, a three-stage Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) framework that emulates the hierarchical reasoning of human seed analysts for single-kernel evaluation. Three sequential CvT-13 classifiers operate on 384x384 RGB images: Stage 1 distinguishes pure from impure kernels; Stage 2 categorizes pure kernels into flat and round morphologies; and Stage 3 determines the embryo orientation (up vs. down) for pure, flat kernels. Starting from a public corn seed image collection, we manually relabeled and filtered images to construct three stage-specific datasets: 7265 kernels for purity, 3859 pure kernels for morphology, and 1960 pure-flat kernels for embryo orientation, all released as benchmarks. Head-only fine-tuning of ImageNet-22k pretrained CvT-13 backbones yields test accuracies of 93.76% for purity, 94.11% for shape, and 91.12% for embryo-orientation detection. Under identical training conditions, ResNet-50 reaches only 76.56 to 81.02 percent, whereas DenseNet-121 attains 86.56 to 89.38 percent accuracy. These results highlight the advantages of convolution-augmented self-attention for kernel analysis. To facilitate adoption, we deploy CornViT in a Flask-based web application that performs stage-wise inference and exposes interpretable outputs through a browser interface. Together, the CornViT framework, curated datasets, and web application provide a deployable solution for automated corn kernel quality assessment in seed quality workflows.

    "summary": "Biological systems encode function not primarily in steady states, but in the structure of transient responses elicited by time-varying stimuli. Overshoots, biphasic dynamics, adaptation kinetics, fold-change detection, entrainment, and cumulative exposure effects often determine phenotypic outcomes, yet are poorly captured by classical steady-state or dose-response analyses. This paper develops an input-output perspective on such \"dynamic phenotypes,\" emphasizing how qualitative features of transient behavior constrain underlying network architectures independently of detailed parameter values. A central theme is the role of sign structure and interconnection logic, particularly the contrast between monotone systems and architectures containing antagonistic pathways. We show how incoherent feedforward (IFF) motifs provide a simple and recurrent mechanism for generating non-monotonic and adaptive responses across multiple levels of biological organization, from molecular signaling to immune regulation and population dynamics. Conversely, monotonicity imposes sharp impossibility results that can be used to falsify entire classes of models from transient data alone. Beyond step inputs, we highlight how periodic forcing, ramps, and integral-type readouts such as cumulative dose responses offer powerful experimental probes that reveal otherwise hidden structure, separate competing motifs, and expose invariances such as fold-change detection. Throughout, we illustrate how control-theoretic concepts, including monotonicity, equivariance, and input-output analysis, can be used not as engineering metaphors, but as precise mathematical tools for biological model discrimination. Thus we argue for a shift in emphasis from asymptotic behavior to transient and input-driven dynamics as a primary lens for understanding, testing, and reverse-engineering biological networks.",

Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.",

    "summary": "Vertical federated learning enables multi-laboratory collaboration on distributed multi-omics datasets without sharing raw data, but exhibits severe instability under extreme data scarcity (P much greater than N) when applied generically. Here, we investigate how domain-aware design choices, specifically gradient saliency guided feature selection with biologically motivated priors, affect the stability and interpretability of VFL architectures in small-sample coral stress classification (N = 13 samples, P = 90579 features across transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiome data).   We benchmark a domain-aware VFL framework against two baselines on the Montipora capitata thermal stress dataset: (i) a standard NVFlare-based VFL and (ii) LASER, a label-aware VFL method. Domain-aware VFL achieves an AUROC of 0.833 plus or minus 0.030 after reducing dimensionality by 98.6 percent, significantly outperforming NVFlare VFL, which performs at chance level (AUROC 0.500 plus or minus 0.125, p = 0.0058). LASER shows modest improvement (AUROC 0.600 plus or minus 0.215) but exhibits higher variance and does not reach statistical significance.   Domain-aware feature selection yields stable top-feature sets across analysis parameters. Negative control experiments using permuted labels produce AUROC values below chance (0.262), confirming the absence of data leakage and indicating that observed performance arises from genuine biological signal. These results motivate design principles for VFL in extreme P much greater than N regimes, emphasizing domain-informed dimensionality reduction and stability-focused evaluation.",

By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.",

    "summary": "Socioeconomic integration is a critical dimension of social equity, yet persistent disparities remain in access to health insurance, education, and employment across different demographic groups. While previous studies have examined isolated aspects of inequality, there is limited research that integrates both statistical analysis and advanced machine learning to uncover hidden structures within population data. This study leverages statistical analysis ($χ^2$ test of independence and Two Proportion Z-Test) and machine learning clustering techniques -- K-Modes and K-Prototypes -- along with t-SNE visualization and CatBoost classification to analyze socioeconomic integration and inequality. Using statistical tests, we identified the proportion of the population with healthcare insurance, quality education, and employment. With this data, we concluded that there was an association between employment and citizenship status. Moreover, we were able to determine 5 distinct population groups using Machine Learning classification. The five clusters our analysis identifies reveal that while citizenship status shows no association with workforce participation, significant disparities exist in access to employer-sponsored health insurance. Each cluster represents a distinct demographic of the population, showing that there is a primary split along the lines of educational attainment which separates Clusters 0 and 4 from Clusters 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, labor force status and nativity serve as secondary differentiators. Non-citizens are also disproportionately concentrated in precarious employment without benefits, highlighting systemic inequalities in healthcare access. By uncovering demographic clusters that face compounded disadvantages, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of socioeconomic stratification.",

    "summary": "Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.",

    "summary": "Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.   We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.",

    "summary": "Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.",

    "summary": "We study a continuous time stochastic optimal control problem under partial observations that are available only at discrete time instants. This hybrid setting, with continuous dynamics and intermittent noisy measurements, arises in applications ranging from robotic exploration and target tracking to epidemic control. We formulate the problem on the space of beliefs (information states), treating the controller's posterior distribution of the state as the state variable for decision making. On this belief space we derive a Pontryagin maximum principle that provides necessary conditions for optimality. The analysis carefully tracks both the continuous evolution of the state between observation times and the Bayesian jump updates of the belief at observation instants.   A key insight is a relationship between the adjoint process in our maximum principle and the gradient of the value functional on the belief space, which links the optimality conditions to the dynamic programming approach on the space of probability measures. The resulting optimality system has a prediction and update structure that is closely related to the unnormalised Zakai equation and the normalised Kushner-Stratonovich equation in nonlinear filtering.   Building on this analysis, we design a particle based numerical scheme to approximate the coupled forward (filter) and backward (adjoint) system. The scheme uses particle filtering to represent the evolving belief and regression techniques to approximate the adjoint, which yields a practical algorithm for computing near optimal controls under partial information. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated on both linear and nonlinear examples and highlights in particular the benefits of actively controlling the observation process.",

However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.",

    "summary": "Forecasting is critical in areas such as finance, biology, and healthcare. Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

    "summary": "Optimal control provides a principled framework for transforming dynamical system models into intelligent decision-making, yet classical computational approaches are often too expensive for real-time deployment in dynamic or uncertain environments. In this work, we propose a method based on self-supervised neural operators for open-loop optimal control problems. It offers a new paradigm by directly approximating the mapping from system conditions to optimal control strategies, enabling instantaneous inference across diverse scenarios once trained. We further extend this framework to more complex settings, including dynamic or partially observed environments, by integrating the learned solution operator with Model Predictive Control (MPC). This yields a solution-operator learning method for closed-loop control, in which the learned operator supplies rapid predictions that replace the potentially time-consuming optimization step in conventional MPC. This acceleration comes with a quantifiable price to pay. Theoretically, we derive scaling laws that relate generalization error and sample/model complexity to the intrinsic dimension of the problem and the regularity of the optimal control function. Numerically, case studies show efficient, accurate real-time performance in low-intrinsic-dimension regimes, while accuracy degrades as problem complexity increases. Together, these results provide a balanced perspective: neural operators are a powerful novel tool for high-performance control when hidden low-dimensional structure can be exploited, yet they remain fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic dimensional complexity in more challenging settings.",

Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.",

    "title": "Towards eco friendly cybersecurity: machine learning based anomaly detection with carbon and energy metrics",
    "summary": "The rising energy footprint of artificial intelligence has become a measurable component of US data center emissions, yet cybersecurity research seldom considers its environmental cost. This study introduces an eco aware anomaly detection framework that unifies machine learning based network monitoring with real time carbon and energy tracking. Using the publicly available Carbon Aware Cybersecurity Traffic Dataset comprising 2300 flow level observations, we benchmark Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Isolation Forest, and XGBoost models across energy, carbon, and performance dimensions. Each experiment is executed in a controlled Colab environment instrumented with the CodeCarbon toolkit to quantify power draw and equivalent CO2 output during both training and inference. We construct an Eco Efficiency Index that expresses F1 score per kilowatt hour to capture the trade off between detection quality and environmental impact. Results reveal that optimized Random Forest and lightweight Logistic Regression models achieve the highest eco efficiency, reducing energy consumption by more than forty percent compared to XGBoost while sustaining competitive detection accuracy. Principal Component Analysis further decreases computational load with negligible loss in recall. Collectively, these findings establish that integrating carbon and energy metrics into cybersecurity workflows enables environmentally responsible machine learning without compromising operational protection. The proposed framework offers a reproducible path toward sustainable carbon accountable cybersecurity aligned with emerging US green computing and federal energy efficiency initiatives.",

    "summary": "Passive and bistatic radar systems are often limited by strong clutter and direct-path interference that mask weak moving targets. Conventional cancellation methods such as the extensive cancellation algorithm require careful tuning and can distort the delay-Doppler response. This paper introduces a convex optimization framework that adaptively synthesizes per-cell delay-Doppler filters to suppress clutter while preserving the canonical cross-ambiguity function (CAF). The approach formulates a quadratic program that minimizes distortion of the CAF surface subject to linear clutter-suppression constraints, eliminating the need for a separate cancellation stage. Monte Carlo simulations using common communication waveforms demonstrate strong clutter suppression, accurate CFAR calibration, and major detection-rate gains over the classical CAF. The results highlight a scalable, CAF-faithful method for adaptive clutter mitigation in passive radar.",

    "summary": "Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.",

    "summary": "Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agentic model. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME, an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-Perceptive Agentic Policy Optimization (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of ALE.",

The primary contribution of this work lies in establishing an inherent equivalence between the quartic inhomogeneous polynomial optimization problem and a multilinear optimization problem (MOP). This result extends the equivalence between fourth-order homogeneous polynomial optimization and multilinear optimization in the existing literature to the equivalence between fourth-order inhomogeneous polynomial optimization and multilinear optimization. By leveraging the multi-block structure embedded within the MOP, a tensor-based proximal alternating minimization algorithm is proposed to approximate the optimal value of the quartic problem. Under mild assumptions, the convergence of the algorithm is rigorously proven. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through preliminary computational results obtained using synthetic datasets.",

    "title": "Encyclo-K: Evaluating LLMs with Dynamically Composed Knowledge Statements",
    "summary": "Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.",

    "summary": "Transfer effects manifest themselves both during training using a fixed data set and in inductive inference using accumulating data. We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.",

    "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems rely on accurate document retrieval to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge, yet retrieval quality often degrades in corpora where topics overlap and thematic variation is high. This work proposes topic-enriched embeddings that integrate term-based signals and topic structure with contextual sentence embeddings. The approach combines TF-IDF with topic modeling and dimensionality reduction, using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to encode latent topical organization, and fuses these representations with a compact contextual encoder (all-MiniLM). By jointly capturing term-level and topic-level semantics, topic-enriched embeddings improve semantic clustering, increase retrieval precision, and reduce computational burden relative to purely contextual baselines. Experiments on a legal-text corpus show consistent gains in clustering coherence and retrieval metrics, suggesting that topic-enriched embeddings can serve as a practical component for more reliable knowledge-intensive RAG pipelines.",

The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.",

Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment.

    "summary": "High-quality reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields is critical for Atmosphere monitoring, yet current models remain constrained by the scarcity of complete training data and a lack of uncertainty quantification.To address these limitations, we propose AODDiff, a probabilistic reconstruction framework based on diffusion-based Bayesian inference. By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.",

    "summary": "The analysis of the interaction matrix between two distinct sets is essential across diverse fields, from pharmacovigilance to transcriptomics. Not all interactions are equally informative: a marker gene associated with a few specific biological processes is more informative than a highly expressed non-specific gene associated with most observed processes. Identifying these interactions is challenging due to background connections. Furthermore, data heterogeneity across sources precludes universal identification criteria.   To address this challenge, we introduce \\textsf{friends.test}, a method for identifying specificity by detecting structural breaks in entity interactions. Rank-based representation of the interaction matrix ensures invariance to heterogeneous data and allows for integrating data from diverse sources. To automatically locate the boundary between specific interactions and background activity, we employ model fitting. We demonstrate the applicability of \\textsf{friends.test} on the GSE112026 -- transnational data from head and neck cancer.

We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \\emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \\emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \\emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \\emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \\emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.",

    "summary": "We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.",

    "summary": "Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.",

    "summary": "Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.",

    "summary": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications.",

Applied to sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, a promising cathode material for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries, our methodology employs an active-learning strategy to train a Moment Tensor Potential through iterative hybrid grand-canonical Monte Carlo--molecular dynamics sampling, robustly capturing configuration spaces at all sodiation levels. The resulting machine learning interatomic potential accurately reproduces experimental properties including volume expansion, operating voltage, and sodium concentration-dependent structural transformations, while revealing a four-order-of-magnitude difference in sodium diffusivity between the rhombohedral (sodium-rich) and tetragonal (sodium-poor) phases at 300 K. We directly compute all critical parameters -- temperature- and concentration-dependent diffusivities, interfacial and strain energies, and complete free-energy landscapes -- to feed them into pseudo-2D phase-field simulations that predict phase-boundary propagation and rate-dependent performances across electrode length scales. This multiscale workflow establishes a blueprint for rational computational design of next-generation insertion-type materials, such as battery electrode materials, demonstrating how atomistic insights can be systematically translated into continuum-scale predictions.",

The method is motivated by structure-preserving integration and thermostat ideas from molecular dynamics, but is used here purely as an optimization heuristic.   We provide the algorithm and limited theoretical observations in idealized settings. On the deterministic Rosenbrock-100D benchmark with 3000 gradient evaluations, FANoS-RMS attains a mean final objective value of $1.74\\times 10^{-2}$, improving substantially over unclipped AdamW ($48.50$) and SGD+momentum ($90.76$) in this protocol. However, AdamW with gradient clipping is stronger, reaching $1.87\\times 10^{-3}$, and L-BFGS reaches $\\approx 4.4\\times 10^{-10}$. On ill-conditioned convex quadratics and in a small PINN warm-start suite (Burgers and Allen--Cahn), the default FANoS configuration underperforms AdamW and can be unstable or high-variance.   Overall, the evidence supports a conservative conclusion: FANoS is an interpretable synthesis of existing ideas that can help on some stiff nonconvex valleys, but it is not a generally superior replacement for modern baselines, and its behavior is sensitive to temperature-schedule and hyperparameter choices.",

This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration.",

    "title": "Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training",
    "summary": "The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.   We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images.

Multimodal DNNs that necessitate feature fusion from multiple modalities benefit from NAS due to their structural complexity; however, constructing an architecture for multimodal DNNs through NAS requires a substantial amount of labeled training data. Thus, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for architecture search of multimodal DNNs. The proposed method applies SSL comprehensively for both the architecture search and model pretraining processes. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method successfully designed architectures for DNNs from unlabeled training data.",

This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.",

    "summary": "Slate recommendation, where users are presented with a ranked list of items simultaneously, is widely adopted in online platforms. Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests.",

    "summary": "Neural networks trained with standard objectives exhibit behaviors characteristic of probabilistic inference: soft clustering, prototype specialization, and Bayesian uncertainty tracking. These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.",

    "summary": "We investigate robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL). In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.",

While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \\& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.",

    "summary": "Generative video modeling has emerged as a compelling tool to zero-shot reason about plausible physical interactions for open-world manipulation. Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

Automating parts of this process is therefore both scientifically significant and operationally necessary to ensure fair allocation and reproducible decisions at scale. We present AstroReview, an open-source, agent-based framework that automates proposal review in three stages: (i) novelty and scientific merit, (ii) feasibility and expected yield, and (iii) meta-review and reliability verification. Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains. Together, these results point to a practical path toward scalable, auditable, and higher throughput proposal review for resource limited facilities.",

While existing fairness-aware models offer partial solutions under GLM and XGBoost estimation methods, they remain constrained by single-objective optimization, failing to holistically navigate a conflicting landscape of accuracy, group fairness, individual fairness, and counterfactual fairness. To address this, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework that jointly optimizes all four criteria via the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), generating a diverse Pareto front of trade-off solutions. We use a specific selection mechanism to extract a premium on this front. Our results show that XGBoost outperforms GLM in accuracy but amplifies fairness disparities; the Orthogonal model excels in group fairness, while Synthetic Control leads in individual and counterfactual fairness.

The method produces an initial reasoning trace, formulates targeted questions that challenge potential failure points, and generates alternative reasoning trajectories that expose incorrect assumptions or invalid steps. These counterfactual trajectories provide structured relative feedback that can be directly used for policy optimization without auxiliary models. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that counterfactual self-questioning improves accuracy and training stability, particularly for smaller models, enabling scalable self-improvement using internally generated supervision alone.",

We first establish necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for these problems, providing a theoretical foundation for algorithm development.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language processing tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \\times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.",

    "summary": "Real-world autonomous driving must adhere to complex human social rules that extend beyond legally codified traffic regulations. Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment. This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.",

    "title": "BandiK: Efficient Multi-Task Decomposition Using a Multi-Bandit Framework",
    "summary": "The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.   To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.",

The method detects outliers based on vector cosine similarity, using a new dataset constructed by adding a dimension with zero values to the original data. When a point in the new dataset is selected as the measured point, an observation point is created as the origin, differing only in the new dimension by having a non-zero value compared to the measured point. Vectors are then formed from the observation point to the measured point and to other points in the dataset. By comparing the cosine similarities of these vectors, abnormal data can be identified.

    "title": "Evolving, Not Training: Zero-Shot Reasoning Segmentation via Evolutionary Prompting",
    "summary": "Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

    "summary": "We study causal discovery from observational data in linear Gaussian systems affected by \\emph{mixed latent confounding}, where some unobserved factors act broadly across many variables while others influence only small subsets. This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.   We propose \\textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.   We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.",

    "summary": "Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.",

    "summary": "Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training among users without relying on a central server. However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.",

    "summary": "Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their \"black-box\" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a \"numerical-semantic\" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from \"passive detection\" to \"intelligent diagnosis\" for battery safety management.",

Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.",

    "summary": "Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

    "summary": "We study finite-sum nonlinear programs whose decision variables interact locally according to a graph or hypergraph. We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.   For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence. Experiments validate the theory and show consistent improvements over decentralized gradient baselines.",

Our method builds on a novel, learned feature-based image representation that disentangles different types of features, such as geometry and contrast, into distinct low-dimensional latent spaces, enabling better exploitation of feature correlations in multidimensional images and incorporation of pre-learned priors specific to different feature types for reconstruction. More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning.

    "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.",

    "summary": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.",

Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.",

We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.",

    "title": "Muscle Synergy Patterns During Running: Coordinative Mechanisms From a Neuromechanical Perspective",
    "summary": "Running is a fundamental form of human locomotion and a key task for evaluating neuromuscular control and lower-limb coordination. In recent years, muscle synergy analysis based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has become an important approach in this area. This review focuses on muscle synergies during running, outlining core neural control theories and biomechanical optimization hypotheses, summarizing commonly used decomposition methods (e.g., PCA, ICA, FA, NMF) and emerging autoencoder-based approaches. We synthesize findings on the development and evolution of running-related synergies across the lifespan, examine how running surface, speed, foot-strike pattern, fatigue, and performance level modulate synergy patterns, and describe characteristic alterations in populations with knee osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain, and stroke. Current evidence suggests that the number and basic structure of lower-limb synergies during running are relatively stable, whereas spatial muscle weightings and motor primitives are highly plastic and sensitive to task demands, fatigue, and pathology. However, substantial methodological variability remains in EMG channel selection, preprocessing pipelines, and decomposition algorithms, and direct neurophysiological validation and translational application are still limited. Future work should prioritize standardized processing protocols, integration of multi-source neuromusculoskeletal data, nonlinear modeling, and longitudinal intervention studies to better exploit muscle synergy analysis in sports biomechanics, athletic training, and rehabilitation medicine.",

    "summary": "Autonomous mobile robots operating in complex, dynamic environments face the dual challenge of navigating large-scale, structurally diverse spaces with static obstacles while safely interacting with various moving agents. Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.",

    "summary": "Lipophilicity (logP) prediction remains central to drug discovery, yet linear regression models for this task frequently violate statistical assumptions in ways that invalidate their reported performance metrics. We analyzed 426,850 bioactive molecules from a rigorously curated intersection of PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules databases, revealing severe heteroskedasticity in linear models predicting computed logP values (XLOGP3): residual variance increases 4.2-fold in lipophilic regions (logP greater than 5) compared to balanced regions (logP 2 to 4). Classical remediation strategies (Weighted Least Squares and Box-Cox transformation) failed to resolve this violation (Breusch-Pagan p-value less than 0.0001 for all variants). Tree-based ensemble methods (Random Forest R-squared of 0.764, XGBoost R-squared of 0.765) proved inherently robust to heteroskedasticity while delivering superior predictive performance. SHAP analysis resolved a critical multicollinearity paradox: despite a weak bivariate correlation of 0.146, molecular weight emerged as the single most important predictor (mean absolute SHAP value of 0.573), with its effect suppressed in simple correlations by confounding with topological polar surface area (TPSA). These findings demonstrate that standard linear models face fundamental challenges for computed lipophilicity prediction and provide a principled framework for interpreting ensemble models in QSAR applications.",

UCL's structural overhead function O_s(A) explains version-specific performance differences through the Over-Specification Paradox: beyond threshold S* = 0.509, additional specification degrades performance quadratically. Core mechanisms -- indicator functions (I_i in {0,1}), structural overhead (O_s = gamma * sum(ln C_k)), early binding -- are validated. Notably, optimal UCL configuration varies by model architecture -- certain models (e.g., Llama 4 Scout) require version-specific adaptations (V4.1).

    "title": "DynaFix: Iterative Automated Program Repair Driven by Execution-Level Dynamic Information",
    "summary": "Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.   To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.",

We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general.",

    "summary": "Benign laryngeal voice disorders affect nearly one in five individuals and often manifest as dysphonia, while also serving as non-invasive indicators of broader physiological dysfunction. We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health.",

    "summary": "Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior.

    "summary": "Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \\textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \\textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \\textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \\textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\\%) and GAIA (72.8\\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\\% and +5.4\\% respectively.

    "summary": "This paper proposes a chat-driven network management framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) with optimization-based virtual network allocation, enabling intuitive and reliable reconfiguration of virtual network services. Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.",

Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.",

    "summary": "As generative AI systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, regulating multiple dimensions of model behavior has become essential. We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that leverage this sequential structure. The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels. We evaluate our framework on a three-constraint Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, where the goal is to maximize helpfulness subject to multiple safety constraints, and where scores are generated by a Large Language Model judge and a perplexity filter. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can control each individual risk at close to the target level.",

    "summary": "We propose a novel framework for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) that incorporates robustness against transition uncertainty. We define two distinct yet coupled risk measures: an inner risk measure addressing state and cost randomness and an outer risk measure capturing transition dynamics uncertainty. Our framework unifies and generalizes most existing RL frameworks by permitting general coherent risk measures for both inner and outer risk measures. Within this framework, we construct a risk-sensitive robust Markov decision process (RSRMDP), derive its Bellman equation, and provide error analysis under a given posterior distribution. We further develop a Bayesian Dynamic Programming (Bayesian DP) algorithm that alternates between posterior updates and value iteration. The approach employs an estimator for the risk-based Bellman operator that combines Monte Carlo sampling with convex optimization, for which we prove strong consistency guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy in the training environment and analyze both the sample complexity and the computational complexity under the Dirichlet posterior and CVaR. Finally, we validate our approach through two numerical experiments. The results exhibit excellent convergence properties while providing intuitive demonstrations of its advantages in both risk-sensitivity and robustness. Empirically, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm through an application on option hedging.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.",

    "summary": "Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are essential for large enterprises to monitor their IT infrastructure by ingesting and analyzing millions of logs and events daily. Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.",

    "summary": "Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.",

However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of \"Minimal Intent Aligning Patches\" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed.",

For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\\times$ 35 (1225 spins).

    "summary": "Generating humorous memes is a challenging multimodal task that moves beyond direct image-to-caption supervision. It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group.",

We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.",

    "title": "A Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Task Learning for Missing PMU Data Reconstruction",
    "summary": "In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.",

    "title": "BF-APNN: A Low-Memory Method for Accelerating the Solution of Radiative Transfer Equations",
    "summary": "The Radiative Transfer Equations (RTEs) exhibit high dimensionality and multiscale characteristics, rendering conventional numerical methods computationally intensive. Existing deep learning methods perform well in low-dimensional or linear RTEs, but still face many challenges with high-dimensional or nonlinear RTEs. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Basis Function Asymptotically Preserving Neural Network (BF-APNN), a framework that inherits the advantages of Radiative Transfer Asymptotically Preserving Neural Network (RT-APNN) and accelerates the solution process. By employing basis function expansion on the microscopic component, derived from micro-macro decomposition, BF-APNN effectively mitigates the computational burden associated with evaluating high-dimensional integrals during training. Numerical experiments, which involve challenging RTE scenarios featuring, nonlinearity, discontinuities, and multiscale behavior, demonstrate that BF-APNN substantially reduces training time compared to RT-APNN while preserving high solution accuracy. Moreover, BF-APNN exhibits superior performance in addressing complex, high-dimensional RTE problems, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for radiative transfer computations.",

    "title": "From Building Blocks to Planning: Multi-Step Spatial Reasoning in LLMs with Reinforcement Learning",
    "summary": "Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.",

    "title": "Dimension-free estimators of gradients of functions with(out) non-independent variables",
    "summary": "This study proposes a unified stochastic framework for approximating and computing the gradient of every smooth function evaluated at non-independent variables, using $\\ell_p$-spherical distributions on $\\R^d$ with $d, p\\geq 1$. The upper-bounds of the bias of the gradient surrogates do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality for any $p\\geq 1$. Also, the mean squared errors (MSEs) of the gradient estimators are bounded by $K_0 N^{-1} d$ for any $p \\in [1, 2]$, and by $K_1 N^{-1} d^{2/p}$ when $2 \\leq p \\ll d$ with $N$ the sample size and $K_0, K_1$ some constants. Taking $\\max\\left\\{2, \\log(d) \\right\\} < p \\ll d$ allows for achieving dimension-free upper-bounds of MSEs. In the case where $d\\ll p< +\\infty$, the upper-bound $K_2 N^{-1} d^{2-2/p}/ (d+2)^2$ is reached with $K_2$ a constant. Such results lead to dimension-free MSEs of the proposed estimators, which boil down to estimators of the traditional gradient when the variables are independent. Numerical comparisons show the efficiency of the proposed approach.",

    "title": "Generative AI-enhanced Sector-based Investment Portfolio Construction",
    "summary": "This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) from leading providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI) can be applied to quantitative sector-based portfolio construction. We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025).   Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency.   This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid AI-quantitative frameworks, integrating LLM reasoning with established optimization techniques, to produce more robust and adaptive investment strategies.",

This study investigates the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures ResNetRS, RegNet, and EfficientNetV2 using transfer learning for the automated classification of pediatric chest Xray images as either pneumonia or normal.A curated subset of 1,000 chest X-ray images was extracted from a publicly available dataset originally comprising 5,856 pediatric images. All images were preprocessed and labeled for binary classification. Each model was fine-tuned using pretrained ImageNet weights and evaluated based on accuracy and sensitivity. RegNet achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 92.4 and a sensitivity of 90.1, followed by ResNetRS (accuracy: 91.9, sensitivity: 89.3) and EfficientNetV2 (accuracy: 88.5, sensitivity: 88.1).",
